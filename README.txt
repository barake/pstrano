pstrano is a capistrano like deployment and automation tool specifically for Windows and Powershell. I have borrowed heavily from psake (http://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake) for the initial structure of the module. The task system has been changed to support before and after syntax instead of -depends.

This tool is very much considered Alpha status.

No real functionality yet, just the basic framework for creating and executing tasks
